<p>
For this project, my partner and I aimed to create a tip calculator for the people who wanted to get the cost of tips quickly or those who struggled to calculate tip on their own. To make this app more appealing than calculating tip yourself or using a different app, we attempted to implement the library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to enter data by reading an image of the receipt. By the end of the project, the app reflected mostly what we had planned out for the project. There were still some minor bugs. Two main bugs was that the OCR activity did not go back to the tip calculatorâ€™s main activity after reading the image, and the output displayed more decimal places than necessary for monetary values. Additionally, we wanted to add a feature that such as saving and viewing past entries so that a user can review and remember their expenses.
