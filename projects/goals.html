  The project which became
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>
  started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

  Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.
