<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Look 'n' Cook was my final project for ICE314, Software Engineering I. All the teams in the class were working to create an app that would improve the college-life of the students at the University of Hawaii. These projects varied from study tools to housing assistance to daily functions. Working in a group of three, we had a little less than five weeks to implement all the pages and functionality that we had planned out .

This project was a test of our understanding and skills learned throughout the semester. As we learned at the beginning of the semester, we used JavaScript to manipulate existing data and create usable data. Around the later-middle of the semester, we learned Semantic UI React, and utilized this knowledge heavily to design a visually-pleasing app layout. At the very end of the semester, we learned MongoDB which allowed us to create databases which would prove to be very useful in storing all the data created and saved by the app. To do this, we used the IntelliJ IDE to create all of our code and Meteor to test and deploy it.
