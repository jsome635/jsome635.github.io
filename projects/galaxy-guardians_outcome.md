<p>
At the end of the project, we were able to complete all of the main features that we had planned for the game. Presenting our project to the class, we were able to proudly showcase the end product of our efforts. At the beginning of the project, we had assumed that the project would be fairly quick and go by smoothly. As we dove into the depth of all the details, even a game 2D-scrolling Bullet Hell game can be quite difficult to implement.

<p>
We were exteremely satisfied with the outcome project, but there were some features like bombs or shields that we wish we could have implemented. Additionally, there seemed to be a bug the would occasionally occur that made a random enemy attack in a way that wasn't intended, but it only made a small portion of the game insanely difficult rather than being game breaking. Other than that, there were no other issues with the game. We also had some talk about including background music, laser or explosion sounds, or destuction animations, but we had reached the deadline of the project and it was not something that was taught to us as part of the class.
