<h2>What I Learned from this Project</h2>
<p>
Look 'n' Cook was my final project for ICE314, Software Engineering I. Although the project was a test of our understanding and skills learned throughout the semester, it was a good opportunity to experiment with all the material. We utilized almost everything we learned with JavaScript, Semantic UI React, and MongoDB. During the semester, we were given instructions on databases, handed the Schema we would use, recreating existing websites, and creating apps only we could run. Given (nearly) complete freedom with the app allowed us to not only create a unique app, but also learn and struggle with the components of all the tools we were using.
</p>
<p>
One of our most difficult tasks was definitely designing and implementing a Schema so that our data was stored properly. 
</p>


which allowed us to create databases which would prove to be very useful in storing all the data created and saved by the app. To do this, we used the IntelliJ IDE to create all of our code and Meteor to test and deploy it.
