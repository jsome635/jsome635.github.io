<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
At the University of Hawaii at Manoa, there are three dorms filled with students from other states, other counrties, and other islands. There are also local kids who have decided to live closer to school than with their parents. Additionally, there are many students who live at the apartments not too far from campus. It goes without saying that many of these students have allergies or diets that restrict the foods they can eat. Eating out can become very expensive in a short amount of time. The cafeterias sometimes provide high-calorie-small-portion meals. Some students want to cook, but simply do not have the courage or the knowledge to do so. Look 'n' Cook aims to provide a student "cookbook" for all the students of the University of Hawaii system. It allows UH students to create recipes and share them with the other who have an account for the app. When adding a recipe, the user needs to provide:
 <ul>
  <li>The recipe name</li>
  <li>A picture</li>
  <li>A brief description</li>
  <li>The required ingredients</li>
  <li>The instructions to prepare the dish</li>
 </ul>
The user can also include dietary restrictions such as dairy-free, gluten-free, or vegan.
</p>
<p>
Look 'n' Cook can provide students with great recipes, but how can they make great recipes without great ingredients? Look 'n' Cook also allows vendors to create accounts, and be part of the Look 'n' Cook community. Vendors with create a Look 'n' Cook account can publish the ingredients they have in stock and what price the ingredients are selling for. When viewing a recipe, users are given a list where they can see all the vendors who are selling the ingredients that are needed.
