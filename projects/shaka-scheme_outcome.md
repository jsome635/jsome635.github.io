<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
By the end of the semester, the result of our work is a basic Scheme interpreter. Shaka Scheme could evaluate most of the standard procedures. Because of the unforeseen complexity of macros and other operations of the parser, it needed to be implemented during the continuation of the project which I did not take part of. Since then, the project has been completely reworked; the work that we put into the project has been archived, but is not part of the current version of the project.
