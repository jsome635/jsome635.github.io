<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Tamagotchi is a game where the player takes care of a virtual pet. This game is played in real-time, and can change while you are not watching it. The goal of the game is for the pet to grow up and move out. The pet can be fed, played with, and cleaned. Making sure that the pet is happy, fed, and clean easily leads to the pet aging properly. If the player does not take of the pet properly, it will get sick and needs to be given medicine, or can eventually die. Some of the situations that will cause the pet to get sick are: not cleaning it, not feeding it, and feeding it too much. If ignored for too long, the pet will die and the game will display a gravestone. It can also die if it given too much medicine.
