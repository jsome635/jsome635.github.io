We've all heard the phrase _"Don't judge a book by its cover."_ Yet, this is exactly what we do with each website that we visit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. We like the images, the flashy backgrounds, and the vibrant colors. Occasionally, we come across a wall of text with some solid-color background that just happens to also be the most boring or most irritating color in existence. When faced with those websites, it's almost instinctive to quickly leave without reading the first sentence, even if we're desperately searching for information. The period where Yahoo! and AOL were popular are over, and the internet of now is (mostly) filled with these visually-pleasing websites. 

## Back to 1998

</div>

Although newer websites look nothing like what they did even 10 years ago, that doesn't mean that the old technologies have been phased out. Rather, it is essential for us to understand how those bland websites were made to begin to understand how new websites are made. Using CSS and HTML, we can create extremely basic looking websites.

At the very basics of HTML, there are some essential elements that can be utilized to control the design of the web page. These elements include:

<ul>
  <li>Paragraph</li>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Hyperlink</li>
  <li>List</li>
  <li>Image</li>
</ul>

Using these elements, we can create web pages very similar to the the most generic site that we can think of. By adding CSS into the mix, we can begin to add styles to change the visual appearance of the websiteâ€”font color, background color, margins, and much more. This isn't to say that it's completely impossible to create a fancy, attractive website, just very difficult being limited to such few elements.

So why not just stick to CSS and HTML if it's possible to create similar, just-as-nice sites? Because we can do it better using UI Frameworks with more functionality and more control. It's easy to make a generic wall-of-text site with HTML and CSS, but in our modern lives where we go 100 miles per second, the information we are looking for needs to be easily accessible and delivered on a silver platter. We can still do that using just HTML and CSS, but why go through the trouble of working with only a handful of tools when there's a shiny, new, fully-equipped toolbox ready to do the job.

## Beautiful and Difficult

Programming languages take years to master, and UI Frameworks are no different. Learning Semantic UI for a week, emulating pre-existing sites becomes a feasible task. However, understanding what does what and what goes where can be the frustrating part.

    <h5 class="ui center aligned header">Official Website</h5>

  </div>

Sometimes the section of the page don't sit where you want them to, or appear where you think they should, to fill the space like you planned.

## Always Something Better
