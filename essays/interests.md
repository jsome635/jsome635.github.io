One of the hardest questions for me to answer is, "what made you choose to go to school for Computer Engineering?" I can only say that I walked into the advisor's office before my first semester at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and asked if I could change from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Engineering. Honestly, there was no particular reason from me to transfer; I was not talking to current students, I did not look into the types of classes I would be taking, I did not research the kind of jobs that I would be able to find. I had some related interests--computers and video games--but those alone do not represent my choice to become a Computer Engineer. In fact, I had studied AutoCAD heavily during high school and received a recognition diploma for related activities. Even with no past programming experience, I decided to forego the seemingly obvious route. Luckily, I found that I enjoyed programming as much as I did AutoCAD. My first programming class quickly sparked a deep, newfound interest that would drive me to grow as a Software Engineer.

My journey as a Software Engineer thus far has been interesting. During my 

For my future as a Software Engineer, I do not plan to stop learning and growing. I keep telling myself to learn new languages, and even have a list of which ones I would like to learn first. Additionally, I am always trying to improve my coding style so that it is easily readable and exhibits good coding habits. I hope to earn at least one internship before I graduate. I am aware that an internship could potentially lead to a career immediately after graduation, or at least have some merit to a future employer. At the very least, I am working to become just as knowledgeable in theories and practices as some of my peers, who seem leagues ahead of me and have the answers for everything.
