No matter what field you are in, there is no way for someone to know absolutely everything about anything. Programmers and Software Engineers are no exception to this. Sometimes, we get stumped on an error, and we stare at the same line of code for hours without making any progress. Sometimes, you are trying to set-up your environment, and it feels as if you have angered the programming gods. Sometimes, we get a little curious, and start researching and testing things out just for fun. In these situations, how do we get the answers we are looking for? By asking questions the **smart way**. This week in ICS 314, we are learning how to ask meaningful questions that, in return, get meaningful asnwers. We can turn to our classmates and co-workers, and they may be able to solve our problem; When they cannot provided a satisfactory answer, the numerous forums and mailing lists have communities with the knowledge to give some insight and suggestions that may lead us to the answer. In <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"</a>, the authors extensively explain what makes one question better than another. 

## What Makes a Question "Smart"? 

In the article, the authors point out some very compelling strategies for asking good, smart questions. One way to make begin

## How to Look Like a Fool

Among the thousands of questions that are posted on StackExchange, there are many examples of bad questions. For instance, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2210928/how-i-do-fibonaci-sequence-under-1000">"How do I fibonaci squence under 1000?"</a>. The poster is needs help with code for a Fibonacci sequence. There are many things wrong with this post. First, the title has grammatical errors. Not only is Fibonacci spelt wrong, but the user is also missing words like a _do_ between "How" and "I". Additionally, the title is unclear as to what the user's goal is. Is he trying to solve the the sequence for all numbers under 1000 or the first 1000 numbers. In the body of the post, he adds no more information about his problem other than his block of code and a "I'm so confused?? :(". In the replies to the question, you can blatantly see that this is a bad question. They are asking if the poster even understands the Fibonacci sequence, and tell him to explain more. Additionally, creating a function that prints the Fibonacci sequence is a very common problem. There are probably other posts that have asked the same question, but in a way that was more clear and concise. This user simply decided to ignore everything that makes a question smart.
