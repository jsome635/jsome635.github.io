## ESLint

ESLint has been extremely useful with IntelliJ Idea.

## Learning

Having a coding standard can help someone learn a new programming language, but only if it is working with an IDE that actively highlights the errors.

## Readability

In short programs like we have been creating in class, the importance of coding standards is not as apparent. However, on large projects with thousands of lines of code and multiple collaborators, having a set coding standard can help the project move along nicely.
