## Relation to Other Languages

During this past week of ICS 314, we learned the basics of JavaScript: variable declarations, function declarations, and many other various things. Coming into this class with experience in C and C++, most of the syntax and keywords are familiar, and it was not very difficult to get used to JavaScript. We do have Workout of the Day (WOD), a quick coding challenge, at the end of the week to test out the skills that we picked up. I was stressed heading into the WOD, and feared the worst. Since I am familiar with languages similar to JavaScript, I was able to quickly write a block of code that output a result close to what was expected. A quick fix to the order of my if-else statements solved my problems, and the WOD was over for me in a few minutes. JavaScript, based on the things I have learned this week, is easy for me to write, and can do some interesting things. As for the WODs, I thought that it was a quick, fun challenge, and looking forward to when they become increasingly difficult.

## Reintroducing Old Ideas

Learnging JavaScript was interesting because it deals with a handful of things differently than C, C++, or Java. Since I have been programming in C and C++ for about 2 years, it was difficult to get out of the habit of declaring a variable as one datatype. JavaScript lets variables be whatever datatype it needs to be, something I wish at times was possible in C or C++. Additionally, because of my experience with C and C++, I was so used to fixed-size arrays. I was surprised while I was going through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">the JavaScript tutoria</a> to learn that it is possible to simply push and unshift data onto the array without the need of a allocating memory.
